When I saw that [noonpacific](https://www.noonpacific.com), a kickass site that provides curated mixtapes, was working to rebuild their website using React I knew that I had to be involved.  I reached out to the guys and next thing I knew we had a small team spread across something like five timezones building their new Spotify integration.  I helped architect the site using React along with [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/).

What a breath of fresh air this project was! It had been quite a while since I was able to work with a small team and I was quickly reminded how powerful that working model is.  I really cannot say how thankful I am for having the chance to work on this project.  It is truly a magical thing when development, design, and passion intersect so organically.
